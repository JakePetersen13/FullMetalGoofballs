## CHALLENGES
The ragdoll physics were by far the hardest challenge we had in making the game. The way we implemented the movement was physics based, so that the ragdoll would move 
according to the physics, but it's incredibly unstable. We had to limit the way the player can turn, otherwise the model would freak out. Adding weapons at all to the
models was also incredibly hard, as for some reason the models grew inexplicably large when placed in the hand, and weren't rotating properly. So we had to remove them
from one portion of the game. The shopping cart was also something hard to work on as the physics of it were really difficult to produce. Friction, balance, and center
of mass all came into play.

We also had a lot of issues with time. We both also had multiple final projects, along with real life issues that took a lot of time away from this project. We weren't
able to finish one of the gamemodes we wanted.

## FIXES
* Made ragdoll more stable
* enemy AI can target different players
* friction and drifting physics to shopping cart
* reload animaitons
* exit options due to menu errors
